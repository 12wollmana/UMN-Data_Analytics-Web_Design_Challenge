# Latitude
This project is a website created using HTML and CSS to display graphs of weather data.  <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> is the backbone of this site, but I did take some liberties with the styling.
Images used were provided by the class; they were not created by me.

## How to Use
To access the site click here: <a href="https://12wollmana.github.io/UMN-Data_Analytics-Web_Design_Challenge/" target="_blank">Latitudes</a>

I tried to make the website self-explanitory.
